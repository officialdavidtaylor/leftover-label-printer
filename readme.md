# `leftover-label-printer`

> **Inspiration:**
>
> I was tired of finding containers of food in the back of the fridge and having no idea of how old the food was; the precautionary principle would always compel me to throw the contents in the bin.
>
> Now I'm fully informed of the age of the food I inevitably throw away anyways. :)

## Target hardware:

- Raspberry Pi CM4
- Dymo LabelWriter 450 (USB thermal label printer)
  - **Note:** Linux CUPS and the thermal label printer driver both need to be installed on the Pi; The printer name must be "dymo" for this app to function as expected.
